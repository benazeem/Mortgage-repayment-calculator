## Overview

### The challenge

The primary objectives of the challenge include:

- Allowing users to input mortgage details and receive both monthly repayment and total repayment amounts upon form submission.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS Framework
- Flexbox 
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
 
During this project, I focused on effectively utilizing the useRef hook for managing form inputs and minimizing state updates by combining useRef with useState hooks. This approach improved form handling and reduced unnecessary re-renders, leading to more efficient code
 
### Continued development

Moving forward, I aim to:

Optimize the codebase by reducing lines of code while enhancing functionality.
Focus on writing cleaner, more readable code.
Explore advanced state management techniques and refactoring patterns.

### Useful resources

- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/) - An invaluable resource for understanding and implementing useRef in form handling.
- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Provided guidance on utility class usage for styling.
